I will deploy to web when I make a native version for mobile so you can just put your phone in the middle of the table when dueling or playing other game modes. In this Repo are just the main SRC files and a final build just to view.<br>
In the next coming week or so I would like to add a dice roll and to be able to add poison counters for those using monsters that inflict poison.<br>

Thank you very much for viewing. I had fun making something I could use in my every day life.
